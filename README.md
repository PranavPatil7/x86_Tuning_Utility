## What is UXTU?
- It's a tuning utility aimed to help you tune your device as you wish.
- It's created by the developers of [Ryzen Controller](https://gitlab.com/ryzen-controller-team/ryzen-controller), [Renoir Mobile Tuning](https://github.com/sbski/Renoir-Mobile-Tuning), and [Power Control Panel](https://github.com/project-sbc/Power-Control-Panel-v2).
- It's a little lightweight Ryzen Master/XTU alternative for x86 laptops and computers that allows fine control over your device's processor and GPU/s.
- Works best on Zen-based CPUs/APUs or Intel CPUs that are 4th gen and newer.

## Getting Started
_New to the Universal x86 Tuning Utility?_ _No worries!_ _This quickstart guide covers everything needed to get started._

#### Launching UXTU
* After successful installation, locate the UXTU icon on your desktop and double click to launch the application.

#### Navigating the Interface
* The UXTU UI has three main sections - Premade Presets, Custom Presets, and Adaptive Mode.
* These three sections allow you to tune your device however you prefer.
* Other sections include the Game Library, System Info, and Automations.

#### Premade Presets
* Universal x86 Tuning Utility offers premade presets specifically designed for Zen-based processors.
* These presets are preconfigured settings tailored for specific use cases, providing convenience and efficiency.
* Premade presets serve as excellent starting points for customization and experimentation while tuning.
* Simply click on a desired preset to apply it to your device.

#### Custom Presets
* The Custom Presets section allows you to create advanced tuning configurations.
* Depending on your system, there are various settings you can modify according to your preferences.
* After configuring your desired settings, there is an option to apply them and/or save them for future use.
* Custom Presets provide a high level of flexibility, allowing users to tailor their device's performance to meet specific needs.

#### Adaptive Mode
* UXTU features an Adaptive Mode, offering an intelligent approach to optimizing processor performance.
* Adaptive Mode implements an adaptive TDP (Thermal Design Power) algorithm, dynamically adjusting power limits to optimize performance while maintaining stability.
* By continuously monitoring processor temperatures, Adaptive Mode intelligently balances power limits to achieve the most stable performance settings.
* Turn on Adaptive Mode with the "Start Adaptive Mode" button, and adjust the polling rate to your preference.

#### Other Sections
* Game Library: View and launch installed games.
* System Info: View device specifications and information.
* Automations: Choose to automatically apply settings during specified events.

#### Tips for Successful Tuning
* Make gradual changes instead of drastic ones to maintain stability and longevity.
* Be cautious of the recommended maximum temperature and TDP for your hardware.
